# Nexus - Master Workflow Orchestrator

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Updated**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ Operational

---

## 🎯 What is Nexus?

**Nexus** is a master orchestrator that coordinates multiple AI workflow systems (Superpowers, ALD, and future plugins) to deliver the optimal development experience.

Think of Nexus as a **conductor** leading an orchestra:
- Each plugin is an instrument (Superpowers, ALD, MCPs, etc.)
- Nexus makes them play together harmoniously
- You get beautiful music (efficient, high-quality development)

### ⭐ NEW: MCP Integration (v1.1.0)

Nexus now automatically integrates **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools**:

- ✅ **Auto-Detection**: Discovers Supabase, Chrome DevTools, GitHub MCPs automatically
- ✅ **Auto-Injection**: Keywords trigger MCP usage (zero manual invocation)
- ✅ **Policy Enforcement**: Mandatory validations (UI, security) auto-enforced
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box

**Example**:
```bash
/nexus implement product listing UI
# → Auto-injects Chrome DevTools UI validation (MANDATORY via Policy 12.2)
# → Validates console (0 errors), network (all succeed), UI snapshot
# → Workflow FAILS if validation fails
```

📖 **Full MCP Integration Guide**: [`MCP-INTEGRATION.md`](./MCP-INTEGRATION.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Usage

```bash
/nexus [task description]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Complex feature
/nexus implement checkout with Stripe

# Quick bugfix
/nexus fix login button spacing

# Code review
/nexus review my implementation

# Refactoring
/nexus refactor UserList component for performance
```

---

## ⚡ How It Works

```
1. User invokes: /nexus implement checkout
                      ↓
2. Nexus analyzes:   Intent? Complexity? Context?
                      ↓
3. Nexus suggests:   "Recommended: feature-full.yml"
                      ↓
4. User confirms:    "Use as-is" or customize
                      ↓
5. Nexus executes:   Brainstorm → Plan → Execute → Validate → Review
    (coordinates)    (Superpowers + ALD working together)
                      ↓
6. Result:           Feature complete, policies followed, ready to merge
```

### Adding New Plugins

Want to add LangChain, AutoGen, or custom systems?

1. **Create plugin metadata**: `nexus/plugins/[name]/plugin.yml`
2. **Register**: Add to `nexus/plugins/registry.json`
3. **Create workflows**: Use new plugin in `nexus/workflows/`

Example:
```yaml
# nexus/plugins/langchain/plugin.yml
name: "langchain"
hooks:
  - name: "research"
    description: "Web research with agents"
```

Then use in workflow:
```yaml
phases:
  - id: "research"
    plugin: "langchain"
    hook: "research"
```

- Approach: tdd (keyword detected)
- Suggested: feature-tdd.yml

User: Use as-is

Nexus Executes:
✅ Load Context (1 min) → Project + sprint loaded
✅ Sprint Check (30s) → In scope ✅
✅ Find Policies (2 min) → Security + auth policies
✅ TDD Cycle 1: Login validation
   RED (3 min) → Test: "should reject empty email"
   Verify RED → Test fails ✅
   GREEN (5 min) → Minimal validation code
   Verify GREEN → Test passes ✅
   REFACTOR (2 min) → Extract validator
✅ TDD Cycle 2: Password strength
   RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

### Example 5: Systematic Bug Debugging (ENHANCED ⭐)

```bash
User: /nexus debug the checkout failing on edge case

Nexus Analysis:
- Intent: bugfix
- Auto-selected: bugfix.yml (enhanced)

Nexus Executes:
✅ Load Context (30s)
✅ Sprint Check (30s) → In scope
✅ Find Policies (1 min)
✅ Systematic Debugging (8 min):
   Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation
   - Identified: null cartItems not handled
   Phase 2: Pattern Analysis
   - Found: Similar null checks missing in 3 places
   Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing
   - Confirmed: Missing null guard at entry
   Phase 4: Implementation Strategy
   - Plan: Add entry validation + tests
✅ Root Cause Tracing (3 min):
   - Traced back to: loadCart() doesn't validate API response
   - Original trigger: Supabase returned null on timeout
✅ Fix (6 min) → Applied entry validation
✅ Defense-in-Depth (10 min):
   ✓ Entry: cartItems validation added
   ✓ Business: checkout logic checks null
   ✓ Environment: API timeout handling added
   ✓ Debug: Added logging for cart operations
✅ Validate (3 min) → All tests passing, edge cases covered
✅ Review (2 min) → No violations

Result: Bug fixed with 4 layers of protection in 35 minutes
Recurrence prevention: ✅ Validated at 4 layers
Pattern learned: Always validate API responses

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

### CLAUDE.md

**Nexus extends CLAUDE.md**:
- CLAUDE.md = Constitution (fundamental rules)
- Nexus = Government (executes within constitutional bounds)

When Nexus not used:
- CLAUDE.md rules apply directly (Pre-Flight Check, etc.)

When Nexus used:
- Nexus coordinates
- CLAUDE.md enforced within each plugin
- Output contract still applies: `CLAUDE.MD ATIVO`

---

### ALD System

Nexus doesn't replace ALD - it **coordinates** it:

**Before Nexus**:
- User manually invokes ald-memory, ald-policies, ald-tester, etc.
- Easy to forget steps
- No standardized workflow

**With Nexus**:
- Nexus automatically coordinates all ALD skills
- Workflow ensures nothing is skipped
- ALD Pre-Flight Check still runs for each implementation
- All 155 policies still enforced

---

### Superpowers

Nexus makes Superpowers and ALD work together:

**Before Nexus**:
- Superpowers: Great for planning/execution
- ALD: Great for policies/validation
- But: Two separate systems, manual coordination

**With Nexus**:
- Superpowers handles macro (brainstorm, plan, execute)
- ALD provides micro enforcement (policies, validation, memory)
- Seamless integration
- Best of both worlds

---

## 📈 Benefits

### Before Nexus

❌ Manual workflow coordination
❌ Easy to skip steps (memory, policies, validation)
❌ Superpowers and ALD separate
❌ Inconsistent process
❌ No standardized workflows

### With Nexus

✅ Intelligent workflow selection
✅ Automated step coordination
✅ Superpowers + ALD integrated seamlessly
✅ Consistent, repeatable process
✅ Extensible (add new plugins easily)
✅ Natural language customization
✅ Learning improves system over time

---

## 🚧 Future Roadmap

### Planned Features

### GitHub Repository (Planned)

Future plans to open-source Nexus:
- Kaizen Core (nexus orchestrator)
- ALD Plugin (included)
- Superpowers Adapter
- Plugin development kit
- Example workflows
- Community contributions

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is Nexus a replacement for ALD?**
A: No! Nexus **coordinates** ALD. All ALD policies, memory, and validation still apply. Nexus just orchestrates when/how they're invoked.

**Q: Do I need Superpowers installed?**
A: For full workflows (feature-full), yes. But bugfix/refactor workflows work with ALD only.

**Q: Can I use Nexus without Superpowers?**
A: Yes! Use bugfix.yml, refactor.yml, or feature-quick.yml (ALD-only workflows).

**Q: How do I add my own workflow?**
A: Create YAML file in `nexus/workflows/my-workflow.yml` following the format of existing workflows.

**Q: Can I skip phases in a workflow?**
A: Yes! Nexus asks before executing. You can skip optional phases or customize the workflow.

**Q: Does Nexus replace CLAUDE.md?**
A: No! CLAUDE.md is the foundation. Nexus extends it with orchestration layer.

**Q: What if a phase fails?**
A: Nexus pauses, shows error, offers options: fix & retry, skip, abort, or switch workflow.

**Q: What's new with superpowers-dev integration?**
A: Added systematic debugging, TDD workflow, root-cause tracing, and defense-in-depth validation. Bugfix workflow now includes 4-phase debugging framework. New feature-tdd.yml workflow enforces Red-Green-Refactor discipline.

**Q: Do I need to use feature-tdd.yml for TDD?**
A: No! **feature-full.yml** and **feature-quick.yml** now include TDD by default. Use those for most features. feature-tdd.yml is only for advanced users who want pure TDD without any planning phase.

**Q: What does "defense-in-depth" mean?**
A: Multi-layer validation strategy that adds checks at 4 levels: entry points, business logic, environment guards, and debug logging. Prevents bugs from recurring by validating at every layer data passes through.

**Q: Why is TDD now default in feature workflows?**
A: TDD ensures every line of code has tests that actually work (you watched them fail first). Making it default means all features get 100% test coverage automatically. You get:
- Tests that prove they work (failed first)
- Zero untested code
- Better design (tests force good APIs)
- Refactoring confidence (tests catch breaks)
- Documentation (tests show usage)

**Q: Can I skip TDD if I'm in a hurry?**
A: TDD is actually faster than debugging later. But if you must, you can customize the workflow to skip the TDD phase. However, you'll lose the benefits and likely spend more time debugging later.
